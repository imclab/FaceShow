An application to show your own face in a draggable always-on-top window so you can record your face when recording your desktop.

Based on an idea by [@Cyrodox](https://twitter.com/Cyrodox).

Drag in the middle to move, drag on the outside edges to resize.

This application uses Adobe Air 2.5, which is basically Flash Player on steroids. http://get.adobe.com/air/

Additionally, if you do use this application in a video, it would be nice if you can give me a shoutout! I make [Android applications
to enhance the application Minecraft](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zhuoweizhang.mcpelauncher.pro), 
and that might interest your audience. Also, don't forget to give [@Cyrodox](https://twitter.com/Cyrodox) a shoutout too - he came up with the idea.

Need a download? Look up - there should be a link to Google Drive with a precompiled .air file.
